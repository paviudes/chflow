# Approximations to a Pauli channel

In several situations it is desirable to have noise processes as CPTP maps whose Krauss operators are Pauli matrices. A key advantage is that Pauli errors either commute or anti-commute with every stabilizer, so they can be corrected exactly. Besides, Pauli errors are also easy to analyze -- the [various definitions to measure the strength of noise](https://github.com/paviudes/chflow/wiki/Measures-of-noise-strength) coincide and simulate, due to the Gottesman Knill theorem.

There are two popularly known approximations of a CPTP channel to a Pauli channel. These approximations are designed in a manner that the resulting Pauli channel is close to the original CPTP map under some measure of the noise strength.

1. Twirling a Pauli channel: In the Pauli Liouville representation and the Chi matrix representation, a Pauli channel corresponds to a diagonal matrix. For a CPTP map expressed in these representation, _twirling_ a quantum channel corresponds to dropping the off-diagonal entries. In `chflow`, one can obtain the twirled version of a quantum channel using the `chtwirl` command.

2. Honest Pauli approximation: One of the drawbacks of a Twirling a quantum channel is that it necessarily yields a better quantum channel, i.e, one with a larger Fidelity (or a smaller value of any noise strength measure). Hence, the twirled channel might not be useful in providing upper bounds to error strength (both at the physical as well as the [logical level](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep14670)). An alternate Pauli approximation of a CPTP, that is designed to yield a Pauli channel with a higher noise strength (as per the Trace norm metric) is called the _honest Pauli approximation_. It is defined in terms of an optimization problem with semidefinite constraints. See [this article](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.87.012324) for details.

Note: The Honest Pauli approximation, though can be used to provide upper bounds on the logical fault rate, these are often found to be extremely loose. See [this article](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.040502) for more details.
