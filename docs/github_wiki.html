## Representations for quantum channels
We will consider quantum channels that can be described by completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) maps. A single qubit CPTP map can be represented in one of the following representations.
1. Krauss representation (`krauss`)
2. Choi matrix (`choi`)
3. Pauli Liouville matrix (`process`)
4. Chi Matrix (`chi`)
5. Stinespring dilation (`stine`)

Refer to the document chreps.pdf for definitions of the above representations. In chflow, when a channel is defined using the `chan` command, it is stored in the Krauss representation. The storage representation can be altered using the `chrep` command. In order to alter the representation from `<oldrep>` to `<newrep>`, use the command

`chrep <oldrep> <newrep>`.
