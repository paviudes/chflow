This package is intended to be used for studying the response of different quantum error correction schemes on various types of quantum noise processes. In order to gauge the response of a scheme, we perform numerical simulations of a quantum error correcting scheme over a noise model and study different measures of noise strength for a qubit. 

More about quantum error correction with various noise processes, can be learnt from [arXiv:1711.04736](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04736) and [Phys. Rev. A 95, 042332](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.042332).

In addition to this main purpose, this package can also be used to perform simple but useful operations on quantum error correcting codes as well as quantum channels. For instance, derivation of the canonical basis (Stabilizers, Logicals and Pure errors) for an error correcting code, converting between various representations of a quantum channel, computing Pauli approximations to a quantum channel and so on.
