This package is intended to be used for studying the response of different quantum error correction schemes on various types of quantum noise processes.

To know more about relevance of quantum error correcting with various noise processes, see [arXiv:1711.04736](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04736) and [Phys. Rev. A 95, 042332](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.042332).

In addition to this main purpose, this package can also be used to perform simple but useful operations on quantum error correcting codes as well as quantum channels.
