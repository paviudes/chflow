Title:
chflow -- A software tool for quantum error correction and noise characterization

Abstract:
Arbitrary-precision control of quantum systems is a lofty goal due to the sensitivity of quantum states to environmental influences that manifest themselves as errors in a quantum algorithm. Quantum error correction and, in general, fault-tolerant schemes have been invented to guarantee reliable quantum computation in the presence of noise. However, in most cases they have been developed assuming a simplified error model corresponding to probabilistic application of Pauli operators. While Pauli noise models are convenient for demonstrating proof of concepts, many quantum processes are poorly approximated by the Pauli errors. Nevertheless, it is crucial to have precise estimates of the quality and quantity of hardware resources required for a quantum algorithm before attempting to build a physical realization. Inspired by this requirement, we have developed a software tool, called "chflow", (available online on GitHub), that provides numerical estimates of the performance of an error correction scheme under different noise processes. Concretely, the software tool can be applied to study the response of any stabilizer error correction scheme under any completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) noise process. Simulations of quantum error correction with generic noise processes are quite resource intensive. However, these could be avoided if the noise on the logical information can be accurately estimated using some parameter(s) of the physical noise model. In the work of [arXiv:1711.04736], it has been observed that standard error metrics can only provide very coarse estimates of the noise on the logical information. The tools in "chflow" use machine learning techniques to derive new operational definitions of noise strength in physical processes that help provide better estimates of the noise on the logical information than previously known metrics.
